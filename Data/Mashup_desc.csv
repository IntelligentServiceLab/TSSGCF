If both users say ""yes"", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want. But if someone says ""no"", the connection is closed and both people go their separate ways. No hurt feelings, no need to ""let her down easily"" and no awkward, half-hug on your doorstep.",MiniDates
